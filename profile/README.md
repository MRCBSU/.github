## Welcome 👋

The Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit (MRC BSU) carries out a range of applied statistical research. This github organisation exists to collate software for unit members and the wider community. These open source, CRAN (or bioconductor) compliant R packages have been forked to this repo for **archiving** and **discoverability** reasons. Issues and Pull Requests should still be directed to the repo from which the fork emmenates.

### MRC BSU elsewhere on github & the public internet

- Chris Wallace (Statistical Genomics) has a software listing avaliable [here](https://chr1swallace.github.io/code/).
- The Burgess group (Mendelian Randomization) maintain their own code listing [here](https://mendelianrandomization.com/index.php/software-code).
- The github account [dose-finding](https://github.com/dose-finding) provides repositories supporting some of the work within the Design and Analysis of Randomised Trials theme. Some details of their work can be found [here](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/research-and-development/dart-design-and-analysis-of-randomised-trials/).
